# VOLUME_CONTROL_AI

we are developing a volume controller in which we are using hand gestures as
the input to control the system , Opencv module is basically used in this
implementation to control the gestures.This system basically uses the web
camera to record or capture the images /videos and accordingly on the basis
of the input, the volume of the system is controlled by this application. The
main function is to increase and decrease the volume of the system.
We can use our hand gestures to control the basic operation of a computer
like increasing and decreasing volume. Therefore ,people will not have to
learn machine-like skills which are a burden most of the time.This type of
hand gesture systems provides a natural and innovative modern way of non
verbal communication. These systems has a wide area of application in human
computer interaction. A systems that can recognize a hand motion in real time
video is hand gesture recognition. Hand gestures are categorized
according to their subject matter. The design of hand gesture recognition is one
of the more difficult jobs, as it combines two significant issues. The detection of
the hand is the first step and creating a sign that can only be utilized by one
hand at a time. It can be used in a variety of settings, including human-computer
interaction and sign language. The basic concept of hand segmentation
and the hand detection system, which use the Haar-cascade classifier, may be
used to construct hand gesture recognition using The configuration comprises a
single camera that captures the user's gesture and feeds it into the system. A
fundamental goal of gesture recognition is to develop a system that can
recognize specific human gestures and utilize them to send information for
device control
